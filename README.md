### Introduction to Statistical Learning

Introduction to Statistical Learning was a graduate level course at BYU based on _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani.

It consisted of multiple case studies where we analyzed a data set using a different methodology and either wrote a report or made a presentation of a summary of the problem and our findings.

I have included the code and report for each of the case studies in this repository.
