### Introduction to Statistical Learning

Introduction to Statistical Learning was a graduate level course based on _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani.

It consisted of multiple case studies where we analyzed a data set using a different method and either wrote a report or made a presentation of a summary of the problem and our findings.

I have included the code and report for each of the case studies in this repository.

**Case 1** - Credit Card Applicants (Multiple Linear Regression)

**Case 2** - GDP (LASSO)

**Case 3** - Auto Sales (Natural Splines)

**Case 4** - Agriculture (Gaussian Processes)

**Case 5** - Car Crashes (Logistic Regression)

**Case 6** - Tornados (Classification)
